This repo is structured as a sequential pipeline and contains only code files. 

Empty `data_*` and `output_*` folders are included to provide the directory structure used in the scripts.

In the `scripts` folder, the scripts in each subfolder `0(N)_*` follow these conventions: 
- Read from data/output folder of lower number: `0(M)_data_*`/`0(M)_output_*` where `M < N`
- Write to data/output folder of the same number: `0(N)_data_*`/`0(N)_output_*`

Analytical results can be reproduced as follows:
1. Create .env file containing `PROJECT_ROOT = [your filepath here]`
2. Download the data files listed in `00_data_raw/README.md`
3. Place the data files in the `00_data_raw` folder
4. Run the scripts in order
